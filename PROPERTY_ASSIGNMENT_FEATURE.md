# Property Assignment Feature for Tenants

## Overview
Property Managers can now assign tenants to specific properties that they manage. Tenants can only be assigned to properties that the Property Manager is linked to.

## Implementation Details

### Backend
No backend changes were needed - the existing `property_ids` field in the users table already supports this functionality.

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. AuthContext Updated
**File**: `frontend/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Added `property_ids?: number[]` to the User interface
- Property Managers now have access to their linked property IDs

#### 2. Create Tenant Page
**File**: `frontend/app/property_manager/tenants/create/page.tsx`

**New Features:**
- Fetches properties managed by the logged-in Property Manager using `useProperties({ myProperties: true })`
- Property selector dropdown showing only managed properties
- **Required field**: Tenant must be assigned to a property
- Property ID is saved in the tenant's `property_ids` array (currently supports single property)

**Form Fields:**
- First Name & Last Name (required)
- Email (required)
- Password (required)
- Phone Number (optional)
- **Property Selection (required)** - Shows only managed properties
- Floor Number (optional)

#### 3. Edit Tenant Page
**File**: `frontend/app/property_manager/tenants/edit/[id]/page.tsx`

**New Features:**
- Fetches managed properties
- Pre-selects the tenant's current property
- Allows changing the property assignment
- **Required field**: Property must be selected
- Validates that the property belongs to the Property Manager

#### 4. Tenants List Page
**File**: `frontend/app/property_manager/tenants/page.tsx`

**New Features:**
- Added "Property" column to the table
- Displays the property name for each tenant
- Uses property lookup map for efficient rendering
- Shows "Not assigned" if no property is linked
- Shows "Unknown" if property ID doesn't match managed properties

**Table Columns:**
- Name
- Email
- Phone
- Floor
- **Property** (NEW)
- Created Date
- Actions (Edit/Delete)

## User Experience

### Creating a Tenant
1. Navigate to "Tenants" in the Property Manager sidebar
2. Click "Add Tenant"
3. Fill in tenant details
4. **Select a property** from the dropdown (shows only your managed properties)
5. Optionally assign a floor number
6. Click "Create Tenant"
7. Tenant is created and immediately visible in the list

### Editing a Tenant
1. Click the edit button (pencil icon) next to a tenant
2. Modify tenant information
3. **Change the assigned property** if needed (dropdown shows only your managed properties)
4. Update floor assignment if needed
5. Click "Update Tenant"

### Viewing Tenants
- The tenants list now shows which property each tenant is assigned to
- Easy to see tenant-to-property relationships at a glance
- Property name is displayed in the "Property" column

## Technical Notes

### Property Filtering
- Property Managers see only properties where their user ID is in the property's manager list
- The `myProperties: true` filter in `useProperties()` ensures this restriction
- Properties are fetched once and cached for performance

### Property Assignment
- Currently supports single property per tenant (first element of `property_ids` array)
- Backend supports multiple properties (JSON array) for future expansion
- Frontend only manages the first property ID

### Validation
- Property selection is required when creating or editing tenants
- Frontend validates that a property is selected before submission
- Backend already validates that the property exists

## Security
- Property Managers can only assign tenants to properties they manage
- The property dropdown only shows properties linked to the logged-in Property Manager
- Backend should validate that the Property Manager has access to the selected property (consider adding this validation)

## Future Enhancements
1. Support multiple properties per tenant
2. Add backend validation to ensure Property Managers can only assign their managed properties
3. Show property details (address, city) in the selector
4. Add filtering by property in the tenants list
5. Bulk assign tenants to properties

## Status
✅ Property selection added to create tenant form
✅ Property selection added to edit tenant form
✅ Property column added to tenants list
✅ Only managed properties are shown in dropdowns
✅ Property assignment is required
✅ All TypeScript errors resolved

## Date Implemented
October 16, 2025
