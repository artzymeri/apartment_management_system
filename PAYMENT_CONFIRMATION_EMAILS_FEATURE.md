# Payment Confirmation Email Feature

## Overview
Implemented automatic email notifications when property managers mark tenant payments as paid. The system intelligently sends different email templates based on whether it's a single payment or multiple payments.

## Implementation Date
October 18, 2025

## Features Implemented

### 1. Single Payment Confirmation Email
When a property manager marks a single payment as paid, the tenant receives:
- ✅ Beautiful, branded confirmation email
- ✅ Payment details (property, month, amount, payment date)
- ✅ Payment status badge
- ✅ Optional notes from property manager
- ✅ Link to view payment history
- ✅ Professional receipt-style format

### 2. Multiple Payments Confirmation Email
When a property manager marks multiple payments as paid (bulk operation), the tenant receives:
- ✅ Consolidated email for all payments
- ✅ Summary showing total amount and number of payments
- ✅ Detailed list of each payment with month and amount
- ✅ Individual notes for each payment if provided
- ✅ Professional multi-payment receipt format

### 3. Intelligent Email Routing
The bulk update function intelligently groups payments by tenant:
- If a tenant has only 1 payment in the bulk selection → Single payment email
- If a tenant has multiple payments in the bulk selection → Multiple payments email
- Each tenant receives exactly one email per operation

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. `/backend/services/email.service.js`
Added four new methods:

**Email Sending Methods:**
- `sendSinglePaymentPaidEmail(tenant, payment, property)` - Sends single payment confirmation
- `sendMultiplePaymentsPaidEmail(tenant, payments, property)` - Sends multiple payments confirmation

**Template Methods:**
- `getSinglePaymentPaidTemplate(tenant, payment, property, isRedirected)` - HTML template for single payment

- `getMultiplePaymentsPaidPlainText(tenant, payments, property)` - Plain text version for multiple payments

#### 2. `/backend/controllers/tenantPayment.controller.js`
Updated two functions:

**Single Payment Update:**

- Fetches tenant and property information
- Sends single payment confirmation email

## User Experience

### For Property Managers:
1. Mark payment(s) as paid via the dashboard
2. Payment status updates immediately
3. Tenant(s) automatically receive confirmation email
4. Email sending happens in background (doesn't delay response)
5. Any email errors are logged but don't affect payment update

### For Tenants:
1. Receive immediate email confirmation when payment is marked as paid
2. Email serves as digital receipt
3. Can click link to view full payment history
4. Clear, professional communication about payment status

## Error Handling

- ✅ Email errors don't prevent payment updates from succeeding
- ✅ Errors are logged to console for monitoring
- ✅ Each tenant's email is sent independently (one failure doesn't affect others)
- ✅ Graceful fallback if tenant/property info is missing

## Testing

### Test Mode (EMAIL_TEST_MODE=true):
- All emails redirect to verified email address
- Email subject includes "[TEST]" prefix
- Yellow banner in email shows intended recipient
- Perfect for testing without sending to actual tenants

### Production Mode (EMAIL_TEST_MODE=false):
- Emails sent to actual tenant email addresses
- Professional templates without test banners
- Full production email delivery

## API Endpoints Affected

PATCH /api/tenant-payments/:id
Body: { status: 'paid', notes: 'optional' }
```
- Updates payment status
- Sets payment_date to today
- Sends single payment confirmation email

### Bulk Payment Update
```
PATCH /api/tenant-payments/bulk
Body: { payment_ids: [1,2,3], status: 'paid', notes: 'optional' }
```
- Updates multiple payment statuses

- Groups by tenant and sends appropriate emails

## Email Content Examples

### Single Payment Email Subject:

## Month Formatting
Uses existing `formatMonthYear()` helper method:
- Converts date to readable format
