Added a new "Monthly Reports" section for tenants to view and download monthly financial reports for their property.

## Implementation Date
October 17, 2025

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes

  - Retrieves tenant's property_ids from user record
  - Supports optional year filtering
  - Returns reports sorted by date (descending)
  
- **`downloadMonthlyReportPdf`**: Enables both property managers and tenants to download reports

  - Validates tenant access to property reports
  - Returns JSON data for download (replaced by client-side PDF generation)

#### New Routes (`backend/routes/monthlyReport.routes.js`)

- `GET /api/monthly-reports/download/:reportId` - Download report (both roles) - **Note: Not currently used, PDF generated on client-side**

### 2. Frontend Changes
