## 📌 STEP 2: Verify Domain in Resend (~15 minutes)

### After you buy your domain:

1. **Go to Resend Dashboard**
   - Login at: https://resend.com/login
   - Click "Domains" in sidebar
   - Click "Add Domain"

2. **Enter your domain**
   - Type your domain (e.g., `apartmentmanage.com`)
   - Click "Add"

3. **Copy DNS Records**
   Resend will show you 3-4 DNS records like:

   **Record 1 - SPF (TXT Record):**
   ```
   Type: TXT
   Name: @
   Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
   ```

   **Record 2 - DKIM (TXT Record):**
   ```
   Type: TXT
   Name: resend._domainkey
   Value: [long string Resend gives you]
   ```

   **Record 3 - DMARC (TXT Record):**
   ```
   Type: TXT
   Name: _dmarc
   Value: v=DMARC1; p=none
   ```

   **Record 4 - MX Record (optional):**
   ```
   Type: MX
   Name: @
   Value: feedback-smtp.resend.com
   Priority: 10
   ```

4. **Add DNS Records to Your Domain**

   ### If you bought from Namecheap:
   1. Login to Namecheap
   2. Go to "Domain List"
   3. Click "Manage" next to your domain
   4. Click "Advanced DNS" tab
   5. Click "Add New Record" for each record
   6. Copy/paste the values from Resend
   7. Click "Save"

   ### If you bought from Cloudflare:
   1. Login to Cloudflare
   2. Click your domain
   3. Go to "DNS" tab
   4. Click "Add record" for each
   5. Copy/paste values from Resend
   6. Click "Save"

   ### If you bought from Google/Squarespace:
   1. Login to your account
   2. Go to DNS settings
   3. Add custom records
   4. Copy/paste from Resend
   5. Save

5. **Wait for Verification**
   - Takes 5-15 minutes (sometimes up to 1 hour)
   - Resend will show "Verified" when ready
   - You'll get an email confirmation

---

## 📌 STEP 3: Update Your Email Service (~2 minutes)

Once your domain is verified, update the code:

1. **Open file:** `/backend/services/email.service.js`

2. **Find this line** (appears 3 times):
   ```javascript
   from: 'Apartment Management <onboarding@resend.dev>',
   ```

3. **Replace with your domain:**
   ```javascript
   from: 'Apartment Management <noreply@yourdomain.com>',
   ```
   
   For example, if you bought `apartmentmanage.com`:
   ```javascript
   from: 'Apartment Management <noreply@apartmentmanage.com>',
   ```

4. **Save the file**

5. **Restart your backend server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```
