# City Migration - Issue Resolved ✅

## Problem
The server was crashing because Sequelize tried to add a new `city_id` column with a NOT NULL constraint to the existing `properties` table, but the table already had data without city_id values, causing a foreign key constraint error.

## Solution
Created and ran a migration script (`migrate_city_to_city_id.js`) that safely transitioned from the old `city` string column to the new `city_id` integer foreign key column.

## What the Migration Did

1. **Added city_id as nullable** - First added the column without constraints
2. **Migrated existing data** - Converted existing city names to city_id:
   - Property 1: "City" → city_id 35 (created new city entry)
   - Property 2: "Test" → city_id 36 (created new city entry)
3. **Set defaults** - Ensured no NULL values remained
4. **Added constraints** - Made city_id NOT NULL and added foreign key
5. **Cleaned up** - Removed the old `city` string column

## Database Status

✅ Cities table: Contains 34 Kosovo cities + 2 migrated cities (35: "City", 36: "Test")
✅ Properties table: Now uses `city_id` instead of `city` string column
✅ Foreign key constraint: Properly established between properties and cities

## Next Steps

1. **Start your backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The server should now start without errors!

2. **Start your frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the changes:**
   - Navigate to `/admin/configurations` to see the cities list
   - Try creating a new property - you'll see a dropdown with cities
   - The existing 2 properties will show their migrated cities

## Notes

- The old city names "City" and "Test" were preserved as new city entries (IDs 35 and 36)
- You can delete these from the Configurations page if needed
- All future properties will use the proper Kosovo cities from the dropdown

## If You Encounter Issues

The migration script is idempotent (can be run multiple times safely). If you need to re-run it:

```bash
cd backend
node migrate_city_to_city_id.js
```

It will check if the migration is needed and skip if already completed.
