# Fix: Tenant Creation Now Creates Users Directly

## Problem
After creating a tenant through the Property Manager interface, the tenant was not appearing in the tenants list view.

## Root Cause
The create tenant page was using the `/api/auth/register` endpoint, which creates a **registration request** (pending approval) instead of directly creating a user in the `users` table. This meant:
- New tenants went into the `register_requests` table with status='pending'
- The tenants list queries the `users` table with role='tenant'
- Created tenants never appeared because they were waiting for admin approval

## Solution
Created a new endpoint that allows Property Managers to directly create tenant users without the approval process.

### Backend Changes

1. **Added `createUser` controller** (`backend/controllers/user.controller.js`)
   - New function to directly create users in the `users` table
   - Validates email and phone uniqueness across both `users` and `register_requests` tables
   - Handles role-specific fields (floor_assigned for tenants, expiry_date for property_managers)
   - Hashes passwords before storing

2. **Added middleware** (`backend/middleware/auth.middleware.js`)
   - New `isAdminOrPropertyManager` middleware
   - Allows both admin and property_manager roles to access certain endpoints

3. **Updated routes** (`backend/routes/user.routes.js`)
   - Added `POST /api/users` endpoint
   - Protected with `isAdminOrPropertyManager` middleware
   - Allows property managers to create tenant users directly

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated user API** (`frontend/lib/user-api.ts`)
   - Added `createUser()` method to call the new endpoint

2. **Added hook** (`frontend/hooks/useUsers.ts`)
   - New `useCreateUser()` hook for creating users
   - Invalidates queries on success to refresh the list

3. **Updated create tenant page** (`frontend/app/property_manager/tenants/create/page.tsx`)
   - Changed from using `/api/auth/register` to `useCreateUser()` hook
   - Now creates users directly in the `users` table
   - Tenants appear immediately in the list after creation

## Result
✅ Property Managers can now create tenants that immediately appear in the tenants list
✅ No approval process needed for Property Manager-created tenants
✅ Floor assignments work correctly on creation
✅ All validation (email, phone uniqueness) still works properly

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. Log in as a Property Manager
2. Navigate to Tenants → Add Tenant
3. Fill in the form with tenant details and floor assignment
4. Click "Create Tenant"
5. ✅ The tenant should now appear immediately in the tenants list with the assigned floor
