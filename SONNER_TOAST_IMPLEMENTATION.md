# Sonner Toast Implementation - Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented Sonner toast notifications across all mutation API calls in the apartment management system, replacing the previous alert-based notification system.

## Changes Made

#### `/backend/controllers/city.controller.js`
- ✅ Added `updateCity` controller function with validation and error handling

#### `/backend/routes/city.routes.js`
- ✅ Added `PUT /api/cities/:id` route for updating cities (admin only)

### 3. **Frontend - API Layer**

### 4. **Frontend - Pages with Toast Notifications**

  - User not found error

#### `/app/admin/properties/page.tsx` (Properties Management)

- ✅ Added toast notifications for:

  - Registration request rejected successfully
  - Error messages for approval/rejection failures

## Toast Notification Patterns

### Success Messages
```typescript
toast.success("Action completed successfully");
```

### Error Messages
```typescript
toast.error("Action failed: [reason]");
```

### Validation Errors
```typescript
errors.forEach((error) => toast.error(error));
```

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Non-blocking notifications that don't interrupt user workflow
2. **Consistent**: Uniform notification system across the entire application
3. **Clean**: Removed redundant Alert components and state management
4. **Accessible**: Sonner provides built-in accessibility features
5. **Customizable**: Easy to style and position globally
