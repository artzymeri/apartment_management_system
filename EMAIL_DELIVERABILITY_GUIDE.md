# 📧 Email Deliverability Guide - Why Emails Go to Spam & How to Fix It

## What I Just Fixed ✅

I've updated your email service to fix the most common spam triggers:

### 1. ✅ Added Plain Text Version
- **Problem:** Emails with only HTML are spam red flags
- **Fix:** Now every email has both HTML and plain text versions
- **Impact:** Major improvement in deliverability

### 2. ✅ Removed Emojis from Subject Lines
- **Before:** `🎉 Welcome to Apartment Management System!`
- **After:** `Welcome to BllokuSync Apartment Management`
- **Why:** Emojis in subjects are spam triggers, especially for new domains

### 3. ✅ Added Reply-To Header
- **Added:** `replyTo: 'support@bllokusync.com'`
- **Why:** Allows recipients to reply, makes email look legitimate
- **Note:** You'll need to set up support@bllokusync.com later

### 4. ✅ Changed From Name
- **Before:** `Apartment Management`
- **After:** `BllokuSync Apartments`
- **Why:** Using your actual brand name builds trust

### 5. ✅ Added Email Headers
- **Added:** `X-Entity-Ref-ID` header for tracking
- **Why:** Professional emails have proper headers

### 6. ✅ Improved Footer
- **Added:** "If you did not request this account" disclaimer
- **Why:** Shows transparency and reduces spam reports

## Additional Steps to Improve Deliverability

### Step 1: Wait for DNS to Fully Propagate (24-48 hours)
Your DNS records might be verified, but they need time to propagate globally:
- DKIM and SPF need to be recognized by all email servers
- New domains have a "reputation building" period
- First few emails might go to spam until reputation builds

### Step 2: Improve Your DMARC Policy (After Testing)
Current DMARC: `v=DMARC1; p=none;`

**After 1-2 weeks of successful sending, update to:**
```
v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@bllokusync.com; pct=100
```

This tells email providers you're serious about email authentication.

### Step 3: Add a Reverse DNS (PTR) Record
This is usually done by your email service provider (Resend handles this automatically).

### Step 4: Warm Up Your Domain
**Don't send 1000 emails on day 1!** New domains need to build reputation:

| Day | Max Emails | Notes |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| Days 1-3 | 10-20/day | Test with your own emails first |
| Days 4-7 | 50/day | Send to engaged users |
| Days 8-14 | 100-200/day | Gradually increase |
| Week 3+ | Normal volume | Domain is warmed up |

### Step 5: Monitor Your Sender Reputation
Check your domain reputation at:
- https://www.senderscore.org/
- https://www.google.com/postmaster/
- https://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx

## Common Reasons Emails Still Go to Spam

### 1. **New Domain** (Most Likely Your Issue)
- `bllokusync.com` is brand new
- Email providers don't trust it yet
- **Solution:** Wait 7-14 days, send consistently

### 2. **No Email Engagement History**
- Your domain has never sent emails before
- **Solution:** Start with small volumes, ask recipients to move emails to inbox

### 3. **Recipient Email Provider is Strict**
Some providers (like Outlook/Hotmail) are very strict with new domains
- **Solution:** Ask users to whitelist `@notifications.bllokusync.com`

### 4. **Missing rDNS or PTR Record**
- Resend should handle this automatically
- Check with: `dig -x [IP address]`

### 5. **Content Triggers**
Your content looks good now, but avoid:
- ❌ Too many links
- ❌ Spammy words ("free", "click here", "urgent")
- ❌ All caps text
- ❌ Excessive exclamation marks!!!

## What to Tell Your Users (Temporary Fix)

While your domain builds reputation, tell new users:

**"Check your spam/junk folder for the welcome email and mark it as 'Not Spam'"**

After a few users do this, future emails will land in inbox.

### Gmail Users:
1. Check Spam folder
2. Select the email
3. Click "Not Spam" button
4. Future emails will go to inbox

### Outlook/Hotmail Users:
1. Check Junk folder
2. Right-click the email
3. Select "Mark as Not Junk"
4. Or add to Safe Senders list

## Test Email Deliverability

### Send a Test Email
1. Restart your backend server to apply the changes
2. Approve a registration request
3. Check where the email lands:
   - ✅ **Inbox** - Perfect!
   - ⚠️ **Spam** - Expected for new domain, will improve
   - ❌ **Not delivered** - Check Resend dashboard for errors

### Check Spam Score
Send a test email to: **mail-tester.com**

1. Get a test email from: https://www.mail-tester.com/
2. Send your welcome email to that address
3. See your spam score and recommendations

## Long-Term Solutions

### 1. Set Up Google Postmaster Tools
- Go to: https://postmaster.google.com/

After 3-6 months of good sending:

### 3. Use Consistent Sending Schedule
- Send emails at consistent times
- Don't have big spikes in volume
- Regular sending = better reputation

## Quick Wins You Can Do Now

## Timeline for Improvement

| Timeframe | Expected Improvement |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Day 1-3** | ~50% go to spam (expected for new domain) |
| **Week 1** | ~30% go to spam (getting better) |
| **Week 2** | ~10-20% go to spam (good progress) |
| **Week 3-4** | ~5% or less go to spam (normal) |
| **Month 2+** | Most emails land in inbox (excellent) |

## Emergency: If All Emails Bounce

If Resend shows "bounced" or "rejected" status:

1. **Check DNS records are still verified**
   - Go to: https://resend.com/domains
   - All 4 records should be green ✅

2. **Check you're using verified domain**
   - Must use `@notifications.bllokusync.com`
   - Not a random email address

3. **Check Resend account status**
   - Make sure account is in good standing
   - No exceeded limits

subject: '🎉 Welcome to Apartment Management System!',

// No plain text version
// No reply-to
```

### After:
```javascript
from: 'BllokuSync Apartments <noreply@notifications.bllokusync.com>',
replyTo: 'support@bllokusync.com',
subject: 'Welcome to BllokuSync Apartment Management',
html: this.getWelcomeEmailTemplate(...),
text: this.getWelcomeEmailPlainText(...), // Added!
headers: {
  'X-Entity-Ref-ID': `user-${user.id}`,
},
```
