# 📊 Monthly Report Email Notification Feature

## ✅ Feature Complete!

When a property manager generates or updates a monthly report, **all tenants in that property automatically receive a beautiful email notification** with the report details.

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Email Templates Created**
Two new email templates have been added to the email service:

#### HTML Template
- Beautiful, responsive design matching your BllokuSync branding
- Blue gradient header with "Monthly Report Available" title
- Report summary box showing:
  - Total budget collected
  - Payment status (X of Y tenants paid)
  - Pending amount (if any)
- Budget allocation breakdown by category
- Property manager notes (if provided)
- Call-to-action button: "View Detailed Report"
- Professional footer with property and report details

#### Plain Text Template
- Complete text-only version for email clients that don't support HTML
- All the same information in a clean, readable format
- Improves email deliverability

### 2. **Auto-Send on Report Generation**
Modified `monthlyReport.controller.js` to automatically:
- Fetch all tenants assigned to the property
- Send email notification to each tenant
- Run in the background (doesn't slow down the API response)
- Log success/failure for each email sent

### 3. **Email Service Methods**
Added three new methods to `email.service.js`:

```javascript
// Send to a single tenant
sendMonthlyReportNotification(tenant, report, property)

// Send to all tenants in a property
sendMonthlyReportToAllTenants(report, property, tenants)

// Format month/year for display
formatMonthYear(reportMonth)
```

## 📧 Email Content Example

**Subject:** `Monthly Report Available - October 2025 - Sunrise Apartments`

**Email includes:**
- Personalized greeting: "Hello [Tenant Name],"
- Report period: "October 2025"
- Property name: "Sunrise Apartments"
- Total budget collected: "€12,500"
- Payment status: "24 of 25 tenants (96%)"
- Pending amount: "€500" (if any)
- Budget allocation breakdown:
  - Maintenance: €5,000 (40%)
  - Utilities: €3,000 (24%)
  - Cleaning: €2,500 (20%)
  - Security: €2,000 (16%)
- Property manager notes (if added)
- Button to view full report online

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### When Property Manager Generates Report:

1. **Property manager fills out report form** (propertyId, month, year, allocations, notes)
2. **Submits POST request** to `/api/monthly-reports/generate`
3. **Backend creates/updates the report** in database
4. **Backend automatically:**
   - Finds all tenants assigned to that property
   - Sends email notification to each tenant
   - Logs results in console
5. **API responds** with report data + email notification status
6. **Emails are sent in background** (doesn't block the response)

### API Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Report generated successfully",
  "report": { /* report data */ },
  "emailNotification": "Sending email notifications to 25 tenants"
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Email Sender
- **From:** `BllokuSync Apartments <reports@notifications.bllokusync.com>`
- **Reply-To:** `support@bllokusync.com`

### Test Mode
If `EMAIL_TEST_MODE=true` in `.env`:
- All emails redirect to your test email address
- Subject shows `[TEST]` prefix
- Good for testing without spamming users

If `EMAIL_TEST_MODE=false` (production):
- Emails sent to actual tenant email addresses
- Professional appearance
- No test indicators

## 🧪 Testing the Feature

### Test with Current Setup:

   - Select a property
   - Choose month and year
   - Add spending allocations
   - (Optional) Add notes

   - Verify it displays correctly
   - Click the "View Detailed Report" button to test the link

4. **Check backend console logs**:
   ```bash
   📧 Sending monthly report emails to X tenants...

   ```

### Test Scenarios:

## 🎯 Email Triggers

Emails are sent when:

**Note:** If you want to disable emails on report updates, modify the controller:

if (!existingReport && allTenants.length > 0) {
  // Send emails...
}
```
