# Safari/iOS Token Authentication Fix

## Problem
The app was experiencing authentication issues on Safari/iOS in the deployed environment. API GET requests (and other requests) were failing because the authentication token stored in `localStorage` was not being sent with API calls.

### Root Cause
Safari on iOS has strict cross-origin cookie policies and often blocks third-party cookies. The app was relying on `credentials: 'include'` to send cookies, but was **not sending the Authorization Bearer token** from localStorage. This caused all authenticated API requests to fail on Safari/iOS.

## Solution
Created a centralized API client (`api-client.ts`) that automatically attaches the Authorization Bearer token from localStorage to all API requests.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Created Centralized API Client
**File:** `frontend/lib/api-client.ts`

- Exports `apiFetch()` function that wraps native `fetch()`
- Automatically reads token from `localStorage.getItem('auth_token')`
- Adds `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` header to all requests
- Still includes `credentials: 'include'` as fallback for cookie-based auth
- Exports `API_BASE_URL` constant for consistency

#### 2. Updated All API Files
Updated the following files to use `apiFetch()` instead of native `fetch()`:

- ✅ `frontend/lib/auth-api.ts`
- ✅ `frontend/lib/tenant-api.ts`
- ✅ `frontend/lib/tenant-payment-api.ts`
- ✅ `frontend/lib/monthly-report-api.ts`
- ✅ `frontend/lib/property-api.ts`
- ✅ `frontend/lib/user-api.ts`
- ✅ `frontend/lib/report-api.ts`
- ✅ `frontend/lib/city-api.ts`
- ✅ `frontend/lib/spending-config-api.ts`
- ✅ `frontend/lib/problem-option-api.ts`
- ✅ `frontend/hooks/useTenant.ts`

**Note:** `property-manager-dashboard-api.ts` and `registerRequest-api.ts` use Axios and already handle auth headers properly.

### Benefits

1. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Works consistently across all browsers including Safari/iOS
2. **Single Source of Truth**: Token handling is centralized in one place
3. **Automatic Token Injection**: No need to manually add auth headers in every API call
4. **Backwards Compatible**: Still uses `credentials: 'include'` for cookie-based fallback
5. **Maintainable**: Easy to update auth logic in the future (e.g., token refresh)

### How It Works

**Before (Broken on Safari/iOS):**
```typescript
const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/endpoint`, {
  credentials: 'include', // Only sends cookies, which Safari blocks
});
```

**After (Works everywhere):**
```typescript
const response = await apiFetch('/api/endpoint', {
  // apiFetch automatically adds:
  // - Authorization: Bearer ${token} header
  // - credentials: 'include' for cookies
  // - Content-Type: application/json
});
```

### Testing

Test the following on Safari/iOS:
1. ✅ Login works
2. ✅ Tenant Dashboard loads
3. ✅ Payments page loads
4. ✅ Complaints/Suggestions load
5. ✅ Monthly Reports load
6. ✅ Property Manager dashboard works
7. ✅ Admin functions work

### Backend Compatibility

The backend already supports Bearer token authentication via the `authMiddleware`. No backend changes are required.

## Deployment

1. Rebuild the frontend: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the updated frontend to production
3. Clear browser cache on test devices (or use incognito mode)
4. Test on Safari/iOS to confirm fix

## Future Improvements

Consider:
1. Add token refresh logic to `api-client.ts`
2. Add request/response interceptors for logging
3. Add retry logic for failed requests
4. Move to a more robust state management solution (e.g., React Query with custom fetch wrapper)
