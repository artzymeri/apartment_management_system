# Implementation Complete - Apartment Label & Mobile Payment View

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the implementation of two requested features:

1. **Apartment Label Field for Tenants**
2. **Mobile List View for Payment Management**

---

## Feature 1: Apartment Label Field

### Database Migration
- **File Created**: `backend/migrations/add_apartment_label_to_users.sql`
- Adds `apartment_label` column (VARCHAR 50) to the `users` table
- Required field for tenants to specify their apartment/unit identifier

### Backend Updates

#### User Model (`backend/models/user.model.js`)
- Added `apartment_label` field with validation
- Field type: STRING(50), nullable

#### User Controller (`backend/controllers/user.controller.js`)
- Updated `createUser()` to accept and store `apartment_label`
- Updated `updateUser()` to support updating `apartment_label`
- Updated `updateTenantForPropertyManager()` to support `apartment_label`
- Field is automatically set to null for non-tenant users

### Frontend Updates

#### Type Definitions
- **`frontend/lib/user-api.ts`**: Added `apartment_label` to User interface
- **`frontend/hooks/useUsers.ts`**: Added `apartment_label` to CreateUserData and UpdateUserData types

#### Tenant Creation Form (`frontend/app/property_manager/tenants/create/page.tsx`)
- Added required "Etiketa e Apartamentit" (Apartment Label) input field
- Field appears after property selection
- Required field with placeholder: "p.sh., A1, B23, Kat 3-Nr 5"
- Max length: 50 characters
- Field value is submitted with tenant creation

#### API Updates
- Updated `userAPI.createUser()` to include `apartment_label` parameter
- Updated `userAPI.updateUser()` to include `apartment_label` parameter
- Updated `userAPI.updateTenant()` to include `apartment_label` parameter

## Feature 2: Mobile List View for Payments

### Payment Page Updates (`frontend/app/property_manager/payments/page.tsx`)

#### New Mobile List View
Replaced the previous card-based mobile view with a compact list view:

**List Item Display:**
- Left column: Tenant name and surname (bold)
- Below name: Apartment label in muted text
- Right column: Payment status badge (Paguar/Në pritje/Vonuar)

**Interaction:**
- Entire list item is clickable
- Opens a modal dialog with full payment details

**Modal Content:**
- Payment details (amount, status, payment date, property)
- Action buttons:
  - "Shëno si të Paguar" (Mark as Paid) - for unpaid payments
  - "Shëno si Në pritje" (Mark as Pending) - for paid payments
  - "Ndrysho Datën e Pagesës" (Change Payment Date)

**Design Features:**
- Clean table-like list with dividers
- Hover effects for better UX
- Responsive and optimized for mobile devices
- Shows "N/A" if apartment_label is not set

#### Desktop View
- Unchanged - continues to use the existing table layout
- Displays tenant information in table format

## How to Apply Changes

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
cd backend
mysql -u your_username -p apartment_management < migrations/add_apartment_label_to_users.sql
```

Or use your existing migration runner:
```bash
cd backend
node run_migrations.js
```

### 2. Restart Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm start
# or
node server.js
```

### 3. Restart Frontend (if running in dev mode)

The frontend will automatically pick up the changes if you're running in development mode with hot reload.
